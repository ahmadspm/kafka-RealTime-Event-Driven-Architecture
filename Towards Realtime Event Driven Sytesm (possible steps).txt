*************** Next steps towards Enhancing Systems Architecture (Virtuoso)**************


  Based on Sensitivity points, Risks and Non- Risks Identify plus points of Existing Architecture
  
  Define a criteria for Real-Time Event Driven System Architecture 
  
   -- Define Sub criteria for Events Ingestion Tools 
		-- Evaluate 2 open source and 2 commercial platforms for Events Ingestion
	-- Identify ways and mechanisms for doing simple and complex events processing
			--Event Driven Architecture Topologies 
					-- Core Topologies 
						
			-- in the mean while define and establish simple events and complex events within Virtuoso
			-- Identify complex events processing engines 
	-- Identify and evaluate suitable architecture style across the pipeline 
	-- Identify and evaluate suitable architectural patterns for overall pipeline 
	--  Identify Real-time - Analytics types in conjunction with simple events and complex events for Virtuoso
	-- Ways and Mechanisms for Real-Time Data Storage and retention  
	-- Identify tool-sets for Real-Time Analytics 
	-- Handling Time-series Data within Kafka and from Kafka to permanent stores 
		-- Identify use-cases for Real-Time Machine Learning
	-- Real-Time Predictive Analytics in Education 
	
	-- How  in Architecture Real-Time Machine Learning will fit?
	-- Try to map key Quality Attributes identified in phase of the project to overall architecture at various levels
	-- How existing Architecture core components will work together with event driven style 
	-- Identification of various connector APIs 
	-- Kubernetes, dockers containers, micro-services and Real-Time event processing
	-- Cloud architecture and kubernetes relationship in-terms of Real-Time Event Processing
	-- How Data Democratization will be ensured across the Data Pipeline?
