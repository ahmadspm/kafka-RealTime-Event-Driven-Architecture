# Designing Real-Time-Event-Driven-Architecture - A Research driven project with key emphasis on Architectural styles and patterns with practical implementations and their impacts on achieving core Quality Attributes of large scale system. 


************** Transforming a Batch oriented large data pipe-line into Real-time Event Driven pipeline***********


This is an ongoing project with multiple phases. It aims to provide detailed insights from architectural perspectives of a an actual enterprise system and its underlying capability to support Real-Time Event stream processing and various associated use-cases based on the organizational business needs. 

- In the first phase of the project overall Enterprise Architecture has been evaluated in context of existing Architectural Styles, Architecture patterns, existing Data Lake Architecture and its underlying capacity to support Real-Time Event Stream Processing.


- In the second phase a Proof of Concept (POC) has been architected to provide understanding and detailed insights of Real-Time Events Stream processing, Complex Events Processing, Data Integration and CDC use-cases. 
- A better understanding of Real-Time Analytics and Visualizations has been provided by integrating some enterprise tools on consumer side. 
 - Various Connectors in terms of Data Integration and Change Data Capture (CDC) are being explored.
- Various Real-Time Data Pipelines have been designed covering some useful use-cases. 

 - As a result of this research study a prototype System for Designing Real-time Event Driven System is designed. 
 
 - How Batch processing architectural components of an existing Enterprise System and Real-Time Architectural components can be integrated to develop an extended Architectural model. 

  - Some useful resources associated to a Real-Time framework design have been provided. 
 - Some of the source code has been provided for testing purposes and evaluation. 
 - Note these are not actual project files. This is provided for only learning and knowledge sharing purpose.
 - I will keep updating related content. 
 
 
 So How to Start with?
 - Start with basics 
 - Do some readings about Event Driven Systems, Events types, streams, Streams processing and complex events processing.
 - Get to know about various architectural styles and patterns useful for events stream processing.
  - Evaluate existing Messaging Systems for event driven architectures.
   - Evaluate Real-Time Event Streams Processing Frameworks both open source and Commercial. 
   - Select one of the suitable Events ingestion and processing framework / tool that meets your needs. 
   - Evaluate Framework in relation to core Quality Attributes of the System.
   - This evaluation should be done in context of architectural styles and patterns across the Real-Time pipelines
   - Implementation alone cannot meet core Business, Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (QAs). 
   - Obviously it is a complex task and requires a clear and in-depth knowledge about modern architectures styles and patterns. 
   - Think how Service oriented Architecture Styles like RESTful and Microservices can be applied across architectural pipelines. 
   - What are some emerging Architectural styles and patterns in the context of Real-Time Stream Processing?
   - How Saga Architectural pattern can be a game change? 
   - How Stream Processing Frameworks like Fink, Flume, Storm and Spark can make a difference in this landscape as compared to KAFKA streams and KSQL?
    - How various Event hubs (These are unique or custom soultions sometimes integrated with Kafka) are provided by Microsoft IBM, Google and Amazon. 
    - How cloude based googel pub/ sub and Amazon Kinesis - Amazon Web Services are transforming Real-Time Event Driven Archiecutres?
    - How Microservices, Docker Containers, Kubernetes and Cloud infrastructure based deployments are reshaping Real-Time Event Driven Architecutres?
   - How pulsar and NAST can be compared with KAFKA eco systems?
   - How Messaging Systems like pub/sub (KAFKA at large) Message Queues (RabbitMQ,ActiveMQ ZeroMQ,OpenMP) can co-exist?
   

There are many aspects to consider while transforming a big data batch processing architecture into Real-Time Stream processing Architecture. Go slow with will defined plans and keep it simple.
