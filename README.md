************** Transforming a Batch oriented large data pipe-line into Real-time Event Driven pipe-line***********


This is an ongoing project wiht multiple phases. It aims to provide detailed insights from architectural perspectives of a an actual enterprise system and its underlying capability to support Real-Time Event stream processing and various assoicated use-cases based on the organinizationa buinsess needs. 

- In the first phase of the project overall Enterprise Archiecture has been evualted in context of existing Architectural Styles, Architecture patterns, existing Data Lake Architecture and its underlying capacity to support Real-Time Event Stream Processing.


- In the second phase a Proof of Concept (POC) has been architected to provide understanding and detailed insights of Real-Time Events Stream processing, Complex Events Processing, Data Integration and CDC use-cases. 
- A better understanding of Real-Time Analytics and Visualizations has been provided by integrating some enterprise tools on consumer side. 
 - Various Connectors in terms of Data Integration and Change Data Capture (CDC) are being explored.
- Various Real-Time Data Pipelines have been designed covering some useful use-cases. 

 - As a result of this research study a prototype System for Designing Real-time Event Driven System is designed. 
 
 - How Batch processing architectural components of an existing Enterpirse System and Real-Time Architectural components can be integrated to develop an extended Architectual model. 

  - Some useful resources assoicated to a Real-Time framework design have been provided. 
 - Some of the source code has been provided for testing purposes and evulation. 
 - Note these are not actual project files. This is porvided for only learning and knowledge sharing purpose.
 - I will keep updating related content. 
 
 
 So How to Start with?
 - Start with basics 
 - Do some readings about Event Driven Systems, Events types, streams, Streams processing and complex events processing.
 - Get to know about various architectural styles and patterns useful for events stream processing.
  - Evalaute existing Messaging Systems for event driven architectures.
   - Evaluate Real-Time Event Streams Processing Frameworks both open soruce and Commercial. 
   - Select one of the sutiable Events ingestion and processing framework / tool that meets your needs. 
   - Evaluate Framework in relation to core Qualit Attributes of the System.
   - This evaluation should be done in context of architectural styles and patterns across the Real-Time pipelines
   - Implementation alone cannot meet core Buisness, Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (QAs). 
   - Obviously it is a complex task and requires a clear and indepth knowledge about modern architectures styles and patterns. 
   - Think how Service oriented Architecture Styles like RESTful and Microservices can be applied across architectual pipelines. 
   - What are some emerging Architectual styles and patterns in the context of Real-Time Stream Processing?
   - How Saga Archiectrual pattern can be a game change? 
   - How Stream Processing Frameworks like Flink, Flume, Storm and Spark can make a difference in this landscape?
   - How pulsar and NAST can be compared with KAFKA eco sytems?
   - How Messaging Systems like pub/sub Message Queues can co-exist?
   

There are many aspects to consider while transforming a big data batch processing architecture into Real-Time Stream processing Architecture. Go slow with will defined plans and keep it simple.
